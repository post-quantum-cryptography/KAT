## KAT for FIPS-204

Compliant with FIPS-204, published on August 13, 2024.

## File format:

There are two sets of KAT tests for each security level - hedged and deterministic. In the case
of ``hedged`` procedure, the ρ′ is pseudorandomly derived from the signer’s private key, the message,
and a 256-bit string, ``rnd``, which by default should be generated at random. In deterministic case
the ``rnd`` buffer should be filled with zeros by the implementation.

| Field     | Meaning                                                              |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ``seed``  | AES-CTR-drbg seed                                                    |
| ``xi``    | Value ``xi`` generated by Algorithm 1 (line 1)                       |
| ``rng``   | Value ``rnd`` generated by Algorithm 2 (line 7). Only hedged case    |
| ``count`` | Test number                                                          |
| ``mlen``  | Length of the ``msg``                                                |
| ``msg``   | Message to sign                                                      |
| ``pk``    | Resulting public key                                                 |
| ``sk``    | Resulting secret key                                                 |
| ``sm``    | Resulting signature concatenated with the message (``sm`` | ``msg``) |
| ``smlen`` | Length of the ``sm`` buffer                                          |

## How it was generated

We use DRBG based on based on AES-CTR (see [SP800-90A](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-90Ar1.pdf)) for generating random bytes. For each KAT vector, the DRBG is seeded with the ``seed`` value (personalisation string is not used). The test first generates a secret and public key. Then it encapsulates and decapsulates the shared secret.

## Differences with the FIPS-204 and caveats
* Doesn't provide pre-hash flavour
